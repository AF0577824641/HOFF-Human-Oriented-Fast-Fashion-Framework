# HOFF-Human-Oriented-Fast-Fashion-Framework
A conceptual and analytical framework for modeling, documenting, and archiving fast fashion artifacts as Phantasmagorical Cultural Objects (PCOs). HOFF integrates social, material, and temporal data to reveal the systemic dynamics of labor, design authorship, digital circulation, and cultural meaning within global fast fashion.
