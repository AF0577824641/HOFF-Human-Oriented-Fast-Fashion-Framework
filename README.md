# HOFF: Human-Oriented Fast-Fashion Framework

The **Human-Oriented Fast-Fashion Framework (HOFF)** is a latent variable model designed to analyze, visualize, and document the multidimensional systems of fast fashion. It interprets garments not just as physical products but as *Phantasmagorical Cultural Objects (PCOs)*â€”complex socio-technical artifacts shaped by labor, material, cultural, temporal, and spatial forces.
